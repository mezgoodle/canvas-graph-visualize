# Graphs
My labs for discrete structures in KPI

## Installation
You can just [download](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/archive/master.zip) this code like zip archive, then unzip and use.

## Architecture
There are main files, that used in every lab
* [index.html](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/blob/master/index.html) - HTML-file, where canvas is set.
* [script.js](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/blob/master/script.js) - main file. Here there are all alchemy for visualization graph.
* [style.css](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/blob/master/style.css) - CSS-file for html page to make canvas responsive.
* [style.js](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/blob/master/style.js) - file to make canvas responsive. Here I also use jQuery(watch on HTML-tag <script>)
* [Program.cs](https://github.com/mezgoodle/canvas-graph-visualize/blob/master/matrix/Program.cs) - file for generating matrixs.
